# Munch
A personalized food experience that can help you plan meals for the week, explore new foods so you don't get tired of eating the same thing, and stay within budget based on your local stores.

There are many websites that help people find recipes and manage their health by providing nutrition information. They have a ton of great and _sometimes_ verified information, but it can be overwhelming to a first time user who doesn't really know where to start. These sites are by no means personal and most of the recipes do not take into account what food you do and don't have access to regionally.

Munch is intended to get you going by starting small, with the foods you know and love and the stores you frequently shop at, building a little variety from there and allowing you to explore at your own pace. Whether you are planning meals for just yourself or a whole family and friends, the weekly meal planner will help make sure you have what you need to make the food you want.
